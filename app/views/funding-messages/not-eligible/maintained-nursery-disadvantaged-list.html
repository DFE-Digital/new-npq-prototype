        You’re not eligible for DfE scholarship funding for the {{ data['npq-funded'] }} NPQ because your workplace is not listed as one of the highly disadvantaged schools or 16 to 19 settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, your workplace is listed as a highly disadvantaged maintained nursery, so you would be eligible for the following NPQs:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Early years leadership</li>
        <li>Leading teacher development</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a publicly funded nursery, you would also be eligible for the following NPQs:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>SENCO</li>
        <li>Headship</li>
      </ul>

        if you prefer.
